# Java Overview

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

## JDK (Java Development Kit)

The JDK is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development. Essentially, the JDK is a package of tools for developing Java-based software.

## JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

The JRE is a part of the Java Development Kit (JDK), but can be downloaded separately. It is the runtime portion of Java software, which is all you need to run it in your Web browser. The JRE consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and supporting files. It is what is required to run Java applications.

## JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

The JVM is an engine that provides a runtime environment to drive the Java Code or applications. It converts Java bytecode into machine language. JVM is a part of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). The JVM is responsible for ensuring Java applications run on any device or operating system, thus enabling the WORA functionality. It does this by emulating a platform-independent computing environment that hides the details of the underlying hardware and operating system.

Java's platform independence consists not only of its hardware independence but also its OS independence, which makes Java a highly versatile and widely used programming language.
